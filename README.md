# BlackJack Game-Project
Our BlackJack is a web game application that was created as a school project within two week. 


Technology Stack:
We developed our project in native js, and use wampserver for the database

Features:

You can bet an amount
Then start a game
Draw a card

To run the database, you need the following:
install wampserver 
https://www.wampserver.com/

To run the application, follow these steps:

Run the following command to install the dependencies:
npm install
Download the node modules
npm i node
Start the frontend by running:
node index.js
Now you should be able to access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000. Note that it might be running on a different port.
