**Gameplay**

Upon accessing the game, you'll see your initial balance displayed at the top.

You can place bets by clicking on the different chips available.

Click the "Play" button to start the game.

Use the "Hit" button to draw additional cards and try to get as close to 21 without going over.

Click the "Stay" button to end your turn and let the dealer play their hand.

If your hand's value exceeds 21, you lose the round. If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding it, you win the round.

The game will automatically reset after a round is completed.
